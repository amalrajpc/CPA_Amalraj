In the CPA technique with attacks on the last order, guessing the key is also carried out in an iteration representing the state in the decryption model. 
This simulation targets the AES  algorithm by guessing the key used in the last-round  AddRoundKey operation or before the decryption round is reached. 
Depending on the value contained in one AES state,the Guessed Key is 8-bit in size.
